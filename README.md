○ Rest: Kotlin or Java (it would be good to have one class (that's not a model) in
another language. So for example if your writing project in Java make one class in
Kotlin)

● Support any screen size & resolution
● The app should work in landscape and portrait
● Write unit tests for one class (You can use Mockito / Robolectric / AssertJ)
